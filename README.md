# Trick-Room
Recording of my study process in neuroscience.

I collected these things from databases (wikipedia, pubmed and so on) & seminars & my collegues.
So I have no copyright.
Life science is a subject fulfilled with involution. Hope you guys (and me, of course) enjoy involution.
(PS: I'm just a newbie.)
